#Visualizing feature maps of VGGFace2 model by Gradient visualization Backpropagation technique and GradCAM heatMap 
1.Repackage the model structure of VGGFace2 model from layer by layer, to block by block;
2.Using Gradient visualization Backpropagation methods to print out the featurmap on each blocks;
3.Using GradCam technique to print out heatmap on each block.
